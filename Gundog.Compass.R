#######Tilt compensated compass method with optional initial soft and hard iron distortion correction and optional tag rotation correction#########
#Outputs angles (pitch, roll, yaw (heading)) computed either by using the standard euler angle approach, or via SAAM (Super-fast Attitude of Accelerometer and Magnetometer - using quaternions) - cf. Wu et al., (2018) [https://github.com/zarathustr/SAAM]

##########################################################################################################################################
#+eval=FALSE 

#Required inputs:

#Raw tri-axial magnetometer data (mag.x,y,z)
#Tri-axial static acceleration data (acc.x,y,z) (for computation of pitch and roll) --> Note, these are not raw values - it is the static ('gravity') component of acceleration. One method to derive these values from their raw equivalent is to implement a running mean (e.g., 1-2 s in window length) per channel and use the resultant values
#Marked events data (ME) specifying the period of the magnetic calibration period (as denoted by 'M' - any other input signifies data acquisition not part of calibration procedure). The mangetic calibration period should involve rotating the device slowly ideally in an open space, away from potential sources of magnetic disturbance, relative to the Earth’s magnetic field.  Each orientation of roll, pitch and yaw should be incorporated in the device rotations (simply put, imagine a pen is attached to the end of the device being rotated and the aim is to ‘colour in’ all parts of a sphere). This section of data can then be used as a reference for the vectorial sum of magnetometry data across all three spatial dimensions, from which ‘hard’ and ‘soft iron’ errors which can occur in magnetometry data can be corrected. 

#Up to 8 method variants of correction to choose from. For rotated ellipsoids use method = 2 (more influenced by noise or more spherical) or method = 3 (default)
#For simple orthogonal re-scaling use method = 1. For non-rotated ellipsoids use method = 4, 5 (x & y axis equal), 6 (x & z axis equal), 7 (y & z axis are equal) or 8 (spherical data)
#As a starting point, I recommend method = 3 if a good calibration period is present. If the calibration period is not great (only 'some' of a sphere is covered when calibrating), then use method = 1.

#The magnetic and gravity vectors are converted from the NED-carried device frame to the NED-carried animal's body frame via de-rotation according to the supplied Euler angles (pitch, roll and yaw --> default values = 'pitch.offset' = 0, 'roll.offset' = 0, 'yaw.offset' = 0 (default assumes no offset). For example, a positive supplied pitch value of 45°, reflects that the device is pitched up from level by 45° and so the function de-rotates by this value. A positive supplied roll value reflects a bank angle device tilt to the right about this axis and a positive supplied yaw value reflects a clock-wise rotated offset.

#algorithm = "standard" (standard euler angle approach) or "SAAM" (using quaternions)

#####################acc.ref.frame  | positive.g | mag.ref.frame######################
#Computation of pitch, roll and yaw (heading) uses the right-handed North-East-Down (NED) coordinate system (measures + 1 g when pointing directly down) - This assumes that the x, y and z input fields for both magnetometry and accelerometery data represent the surge (forward-backward), sway (side-to-side) and heave (up-down) dimensions of movement.
#In line with the above point, #The NED system measures +1 g when facing directly downwards, -1 g when facing directly upwards and 0 g when orientated parallel to the earth's surface. Readings of the magnetometer x- and y-axis are at a maximum and minimum when they are pointed at magnetic North and South, respectively. Assuming that the orientation of the encapsulated device (positioned flat on a table) starts at North, readings of the y-axis will be at a maximum and minimum when the device is rotated 90 degrees East and 90 degrees West, respectively, with the z-axis remaining constant
#Some devices may have a different local coordinate frame, e.g., the END (East-North-Down) coordinate system assume the surge dimension of movement is represented by the z-channel, and the sway and heave dimension, by the x- and y-channels, respectively.

#################Changing coordinate frame of the data to the NED frame used here#################
#This function comes with three inputs to allow the user to transform their device's coordinate frame into the NED that the specific Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) and quaternion augmentation uses to compute angles:'acc.ref.frame', 'positive.g', and 'mag.ref.frame'

#With the NED coordinate frame, the user should imagine that the x-, y, and z- axes of the device are the surge (which represents North/South), sway (which represents East/West) and heave (which represents Up/Down) dimensions of movement. If this is not the case, then acc.ref.frame and mag.ref.frame should be changed so that the function allocates the appropriate channel and/or required negation to readings
#All 48 combinations of coordinate frame configurations are possible to correct for to the NED system:
#acc.ref.frame (or mag.ref.frame) = "NED" | "NEU" | "NWD" | "NWU" | "SED" | "SEU" | "SWD" | "SWU"
                                   #"DEN" | "DES" | "DWN" | "DWS" | "UEN" | "UES" | "UWN" | "UWS"
                                   #"END" | "ENU" | "ESD" | "ESU" | "WND" | "WNU" | "WSD" | "WSU"
                                   #"NDE" | "NDW" | "NUE" | "NUW" | "SDE" | "SDW" | "SUE" | "SUW"
                                   #"DNE" | "DNW" | "DSE" | "DSW" | "UNE" | "UNW" | "USE" | "USW"
                                   #"EDN" | "EDS" | "EUN" | "EUS" | "WDN" | "WDS" | "WUN" | "WUS"
#Essentially, always assume that the x-axis of your device is your index finger, and your middle finger is always the y-axis of the device and your thumb is always the z-axis.
#Then hold up your two fingers and thumb perpendicular (at right-angles to one another) with either your left or right hand to make the shape of your device coordinate system (use which ever hand that can make the shape)
#Starting with the index ('x'-axis) finger, where is it pointing? North, East, South, West, Up, Down? 
#Then, where is your middle ('y'-axis) finger pointing? North, East, South, West, Up, Down?
#Lastly, where is your thumb ('z'-axis) pointing? North, East, South, West, Up, Down?
#Take the first letter of the given direction (N, E, S, W, U, D) that each of these fingers/thumb are pointing in the order stated above, and that is the local coordinate system of your device
#If the magnetometer channels are not aligned to that of the accelerometer channels, then repeat the above process
#A good tip if the device configuration is unknown, is to position the device as it would be on the animal, and starting at North, slowly pitch the device down and up three times, then roll the device left and right three times. Do the same at the other cardinal directions (E, W, S), and finish by circling three times, starting and finishing at North.
#Then see which channel has most sinusoidal wave output when pitching and when rolling. That will reflect the surge and sway dimensions, respectively. The sinusoidal waves of two of the magnetometer channels during circling will reveal the surge and sway dimensions of the magentometry configuration (with the channel that records either highest or lowest values when pointing directly North (depending on if it is pointing directly towards or against Magnetic North) being the surge dimension.
#For example, a DSE coordinate frame requires you with your left hand to point your index finger down, your middle finger towards your body, and your thumb pointing East. This therefore assumes that the surge axis is represented by the y-axis pointing towards South (away from the head of the body (or, in other words, towards your body)). The sway axis is represented by the z-channel, pointing East (towards the right of the body), and the heave axis is represented by the x-channel, pointing down (towards the ground).
#Some devices measure +1 g when a channel points directly towards the gravity vector (upwards), while others measure -1 g. So that any required negations of values are correct, the user needs to specify positive.g = "up" or positive.g = "down". In the above calibration tip, when pitching down first, are values of the channel reflecting the surge dimension increasing in g or decreasing in g. If increasing, then positive.g = "down"

#If method = 0, then it is assumed the raw mag data is already corrected, and only pitch, roll and heading is computed. Only pitch, roll and heading (and quats if method = "SAAM") are returned
#If algorithm = "standard", then typical tilt-compensated compass approach using Euler angles. Otherwise if "SAAM", then the Super-fast attitude from accelerometer and magnetometer algorithm is used (simplified version of Davenport's solution for solving Wahba's problem with the magnetic and gravitational reference vectors)
