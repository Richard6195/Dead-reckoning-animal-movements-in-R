# Gundog.Dead-Reckoning in R
R functions to dead-reckon reckon animal movement from raw motion sensor data (specifically, tri-axial accelerometers & magnetometers) with option to correct for drift with verified positions (e.g., GPS)

#Gundog.Peaks = a peak finder
#Gundog.Compass = computes heading from the accelrometer-magnetometer approach (excl. gyros), including an initial magnetic distrotion correction procedure
#Gundog.Tracks = verified position correction dead reckoning script
#Step by step guide of using Gundog.Tracks (incl. Gundog.Compass operations) - to use in conjuntion with suplied raw data of a penguin walking to the sea
